## Research

### (A) Surface Activated Bonding \(SAB\) Methods
Low-temperature wafer bonding is a useful technique for many applications such as three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D IC), heterogeneous integration, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), photonics/optics, and microfluidics. The Surface Activated Bonding \(SAB\) bonding is a technology that uses physical/chemical surface activation processes to reduce the bonding temperature, which is very important to reduce the residual stress due to CTE mismatch of dissimilar materials. Verious SAB methods have been developed for different applications. 

1. [Combined SAB](/sab/combined-sab.md). Si-containing Ar beam and prebonding attach-detach procedure was combined to reduce bonding temperature of dielectric (like SiO2 and SiNx) and Cu films to sub-200 °C.

2. [Modified SAB](/sab/modified-sab.md) using Si nano-intermediate layer. Using in situ Ar beam bombardment and Si nano-intermediate layer deposition, bonding of semiconductors and dielectric can be obtained at room temperature.

3. [Sequential Plasma Activation Bonding](/sab/sequential-plasma-activation-bonding). Various combinations of O2 plasma, N2 plasma, and N radical activations are investigated for pre-bonding surface activation to improve the bonding energy achieved after post-bonding annealing at sub-200 °C.

4. [H-containing HCOOH vapor](/sab/h-containing-hcooh-vapor.md) treatment for sub-200 °C metal bonding/sintering.

### (B) Hydrophilic direct bonding (SiO2–SiO2, SiO2–SiNx, and glass–glass) at sub-200 °C
To improve the bonding energies of SiO2–SiO2, SiO2–SiNx, glass–glass bonding, we further developed the sequential plasma activation methods for hydrophilic direct bonding based on the existing O2-plasma/N-radical sequential activation. Various sequences of O2 plasma, N2 plasma, and N radical activations are investigated for pre-bonding surface activation to improve the bond strength. We found that the bond energy can be significantly improved to close to the bulk fracture energy by using either the O2-plasma/N2-plasma/N-radical or N2-plasma/N-radical sequential activation.

### (C) Cu/SiO2 Hybrid Bonding for 3D IC
Today’s semiconductor industry faces a major challenge of further improvement of integration density of the semiconductor microsystems. Three-dimensional (3D) integration is a promising technology to address this challenge by stacking multiple device layers without increasing the form factor. In 3D integration, low-temperature bump-less direct bonding technology is a key technology to obtain the stacked structures with ultra-short and ultra-fine pitch 3D interconnects. Among many bonding schemes, Cu/dielectric (SiO2 or polymer adhesive) hybrid bonding is attractive because it provides direct Cu–Cu vertical interconnects compared to the dielectric-dielectric bonding and seamless bonding structure with improved thermal-mechanical stability compared to the direct Cu–Cu bonding (which is difficult to underfill).

This research studies the combined SAB technique for low-temperature Cu-Cu, SiO2-SiO2, and SiO2-SiNx bonding. This technique involves a combination of surface irradiation using a Si-containing Ar beam and prebonding attach-detach process prior to bonding in vacuum. The technique enhances SiO2-SiO2 and SiO2-SiNx bonding and achieves good Cu-Cu bonding containing low-O and ultrathin O-rich interfacial portions at temperature as low as 200 °C. Therefore, the present combined SAB holds promise for Cu/SiO2 and Cu/SiO2/SiNx hybrid bonding for 3D integration applications.

### (D) Cu/Adhesive Hybrid Bonding for 2.5D/3D IC
Comparing to the Cu/SiO2 hybrid bonding, the Cu/adhesive hybrid bonding can accommodate larger surface roughness because polymer adhesives deform much more readily than SiO2 during the bonding process. However, Cu/adhesive hybrid bonding at below 200 °C still remains challenging and rarely studied. Overall, it is of great interest to lower the bonding temperature to prevent damage to temperature-sensitive devices and to reduce the thermal stress and related issues induced by the mismatch between thermal expansion coefficients of different materials in the bonded structure.

One major challenge of low-temperature Cu/adhesive hybrid bonding is the bonding temperature mismatch between Cu–Cu and adhesives. Typically, the temperature required for Cu–Cu bonding (350–400 °C) is much higher than that of adhesive bonding/curing (≤250 °C, depending on the glass transition temperature Tg of the adhesives). Because the high Cu–Cu bonding temperature may damage the adhesive if it is not fully cured beforehand, it is difficult to obtain both Cu–Cu and adhesive bonding at the same temperature. Existing researches on Cu/adhesive hybrid bonding are typically conducted through an “adhesive-first” bonding approach, in which partially cured adhesive is thermo-compression bonded and highly cured in the first-step at a lower temperature (e.g., 250 °C 1 h for benzocyclobutene, or BCB) before the second-step Cu–Cu thermo-compression bonding at a higher temperature (350–400 °C). The “adhesive-first” hybrid bonding approach has issues such as large thermal stress and low throughput. Also, the mutual slip between the upper/lower substrates during the first-step adhesive bonding/curing may cause great misalignment of the final bonded structure. 

To solve the above concerns, we proposed a “Cu-first” hybrid bonding approach, in which the Cu–Cu bonding is done at a low temperature within a short time (e.g., ≤600 s) prior to the long-time adhesive curing (which can be then conducted in batch without compression), as illustrated in Fig. 1(b). To enable the “Cu-first” hybrid bonding, it is of great essential to obtain the Cu–Cu bonding at a reduced temperature that is comparable to or even lower than the adhesive bonding/curing temperature, which is typically below 250 °C or even 200 °C. We investigate and demonstrate a “Cu-first” hybrid bonding technique by using hydrogen(H)- containing formic acid (HCOOH) vapor prebonding surface treatment for the first time. High Cu–Cu bond strength (>100 MPa) and COP–COP bond strength (>6 MPa) is obtained. The present technique can be useful to improve Cu/adhesive hybrid bonding at below 200 °C with small thermal stress, high throughput, and low cost.
