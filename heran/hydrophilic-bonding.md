# Oxide \(Glass\) Wafer Bonding at 150-200 °C

## ➶ Background

Hydrophilic direct bonding of dielectric films or silica substrates at below 200 °C.

1. SiO2-SiO2, Si-SiO2, SiO2-SiNx
2. glass-glass, Si-glass, SiO2-glass

## Glass-Glass Direct Bonding

Plasma activation is used to enable glass-glass direct bonding. Great bond strength can be obtained after post-bonding annealing at 150-200 °C.
