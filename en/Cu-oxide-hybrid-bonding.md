# Cu/SiO2 Hybrid Bonding at 200 °C for 3D IC

## ➶ Background

Low-temperature wafer bonding is one of key enabling technologies for the emerging three-dimensional \(3D\) integration of mi- croelectronic/photonic systems. As an evolution of the Cu-Cu and dielectric-dielectric bonding, Cu/dielectric hybrid bonding promises both direct metal interconnections and enhanced thermal/mechanical stability with a seamless bonding structure during the single bonding process. For instance, Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of a hybrid bonding scheme for 3D electrical/optical hybrid interface. This seamless bonding structure mainly consists of Cu-Cu, SiO2-SiO2, and SiO2-SiNx bonding interfaces. The Cu-Cu bonding interface presents a path for electrical and thermal interconnects, while the SiNxcan serve as a Cu diffusion barrier for enhanced reliability and coupler/waveguide \(with SiO2 cladding\) for 3D optical interconnects, respectively. Because of the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients of different materials, bonding at low temperatures of no more than 200 °C is highly desired to reduce the thermal stress and related issues.

Low-temperature Cu-Cu bonding and dielectric-dielectric \(such as SiO2-SiO2\) bonding have been extensively studied because of their potentials for high bonding quality and good compatibility with the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor \(CMOS\) technology. For Cu-Cu bonding, the most widely studied method is the **thermal-compression bonding \(TCB\)**, which is based on Cu interdiffusion across the bonding interface at elevated temperatures. Various prebonding activation methods, such as wet chemical cleaning and heating in a reducing atmosphere \(like [H-containing HCOOH vapor for Cu/adhesive hybrid bonding](/en/Cu-adhesive-hybrid-bonding.md)\), have been developed to reduce the oxides on Cu surfaces for improvement of the Cu interdiffusion at reduced bonding temperatures. But **the TCB method hasn’t shown its benefit for SiO2-SiO2 bonding or SiO2-SiNx bonding**, which is typically based on the hydrophilic bonding mechanism. Several reseaches on Cu/SiO2 hybrid bodning has been done based on the hydrophilic bonding, however, high-temperature postbonding anneal at 300 °C \[1-2\] is still needed to improve the bonding quality. Cu/SiO2 hybrid bonding at low-temperature \(no more than 200 °C\) still remains challenging.

## Research Highlights

1. A combined surface activated bonding method \(with [**Si-containing Ar beam**](#si-containing-ar-beam) irradiation and [**prebonding attach-detach**](#prebonding-attach-detach) approach\) was proposed,
2. High-quality \(close to bulk strength\) Cu-Cu, SiO2-SiO2, and SiO2-SiNx bonding has been obtained at 200 °C by the same process,
3. Si implantation onto SiO2 surface by Si-containing Ar beam irradiation and water management by the prebodning attach-detach are considered to contribute to the improvement.

## Combined SAB for Cu/SiO2 and Cu/SiO2/SiNx Hybrid Bonding

### Si-containing Ar beam {#si-containing-ar-beam}

Si-containing Ar beam irradiation was used to enable Si-enrichment modification on SiO2 \(Figure 2\(a\)\) without Si deposition on Cu \(Figure 2\(b\)\), thanks to the simultaneous Si subplantation and surface sputtering/resputering effects.

### Prebonding Attach-Detach Approach {#prebonding-attach-detach}

_**Prebonding attach-detach**_ refers to to bring two wafers into contact \(aligned\) in air, transport the attached wafer into a vacuum chamber, and detach the wafers before the bonding process in vacuum. This process increases the Si-OH bonding sites on each SiO2/SiNx surfaces, while removes excess H2O \(adsorbed on surfaces in air\) prior to bonding.

## Experimental Results

High-strength SiO2-SiO2, SiO2-SiNx, and Cu-Cu bonding was realized at 200 °C by the present combined SAB. Figure 4 shows photos of fracture surfaces of the SiO2-SiNx bonded samples. Si bulk fracture and transfer of films from one side to another implies great bond strength.

The Cu-Cu bonded interface consists of low-O and CuOx \(~6 nm\) interfacial portions. Figure 5 shows the low-O Cu-Cu interface obtained. The formation of low-O interface is owing to diffusionof the interfacial Cu and O species. A low-resistance bonding can be expected by using the present bonding technique.
