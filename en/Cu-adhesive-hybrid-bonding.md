# Cu/Adhesive Hybrid Bonding at Sub-200 °C for 3D IC Integration {#tit0005}

## ➶ Problems To Solve

Cu/adhesive hybrid bonding is an attractive approach to three-dimensional \(3D\) integration because it provides direct Cu–Cu vertical interconnects and high mechanical stability. However, Cu/adhesive hybrid bonding at below 200 °C is still challenging mainly because of the following issues:

1. _Bonding temperature mismatch_ between Cu–Cu \(typically above 250-400 °C\) and polymer adhesives \(typically below 250 °C\),
2. Time-consuming _adhesive-first hybrid bonding_ _approach_: long compression time for the first-step adhesive bonding/curing at a lower temperature and second-step Cu-Cu bonding at a higher temperature,
3. Great thermal stress, low throughput, and high cost,
4. A _Cu-first hybrid bonding_ _approach_ is highly desired, by using _adhesive-friendly_ Cu surface activation methods to lower the Cu-Cu bonding temperature to sub-200 °C.

## Research Highlights

1. Cu/adhesive hybrid bonding is conducted with pre-bonding treatment in H-containing HCOOH vapor ambient.
2. A low-temperature \(sub-200°C\) _**Cu-first hybrid bonding approach**_ is realized.
3. The present method enables excellent Cu–Cu bonding with shear strength above 100 MPa at 180–200 °C.
4. The surface treatment is friendly to the cyclo-olefin polymer \(COP\) adhesive.
5. Seamless Cu/adhesive hybrid bonding has been successfully demonstrated at 180 °C.
6. The advantages of the present hybrid process are small thermal stress, high throughput, and low cost.

## Cu/Adhesive Hybrid Bonding in H-containing HCOOH Vapor Ambient

In this work, we investigate a “Cu-first” hybrid bonding technique by using H-containing HCOOH vapor prebonding surface treatment. In this technique, high-quality Cu–Cu bonding is obtained at 180–200 °C that is close to or even lower than the temperature of subsequent adhesive curing. We experimentally investigate the effects of the H-containing HCOOH vapor treatment for Cu–Cu bonding and cyclo-olefin polymer adhesive–adhesive bonding. This technique enables Cu/adhesive hybrid bonding at below 200 °C, promising smaller thermal stress, higher throughput, and lower cost comparing to the existing “adhesive-first” hybrid bonding method.

The bonding process simply consists of H-containing HCOOH vapor prebonding treatment, thermo-compression bonding, and postbonding adhesive curing, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Shear strength measurements were used to characterize the bond strength. The bonded sample was ﬁxed on the shear test stage by jigs and then a shear force was applied on the edge of the upper \(smaller\) chip by the shear head. The height of the shear head was 50 m above the surface of the bottom \(larger\) chip. The maximum shear force of the shear tester was 640 N. Scanning electron microscope \(SEM\) \(JEOL JCM-5000\) was used to observe the Cu–Cu bond and Cu/adhesive hybrid bond interfaces.

## Cu-first Hybrid Bonding vs. Adhesive-first Hybrid Bonding

Comparing to the “adhesive-first” hybrid bonding, the present Cu-first hybrid bonding method significantly lowers the bonding temperature and shortens the thermal-compression time. This is translated into smaller thermal stress, higher throughput, and lower cost. **Table I** compares the features of the proposed Cu-first hybrid bonding and the conventional“adhesive-first”hybrid bonding.
